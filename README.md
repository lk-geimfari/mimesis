# Cognitive Synthesis
### A generator of synthetic data of the nature that might be typical of an Adversarial AI engine for specialized model training dependent on the use case.


**Synthetic Adversarial AI Traffic**
The Orion Constellation project is a cybersecurity research initiative designed to protect against adversarial AI threats through a combination of advanced technologies. It comprises three main components:

Cognitive Synthesis: This tool generates synthetic data to simulate adversarial AI behaviors. It's used for training AI models to recognize and counteract potential cyber threats, creating a proactive defense mechanism.

Orion Crawler: A scanning tool that identifies emerging cyber threats by looking for specific patterns, signatures, and behaviors associated with adversarial AI. Its findings help refine the defenses of the Orion Constellation by providing up-to-date threat intelligence.

Orion Agents: Deployed across network systems, these agents monitor for signs of adversarial activities using the intelligence and training provided by Cognitive Synthesis and Orion Crawler. They offer real-time detection and response capabilities, acting as the first line of defense against cyber attacks.

Together, these components work in synergy to predict, detect, and neutralize cyber threats, ensuring robust security in the face of evolving adversarial AI tactics.

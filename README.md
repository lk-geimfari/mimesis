**Mimesis** is a fast and easy to use library for Python programming language, which helps generate synthetic
data for a variety of purposes in a variety of languages. This data can be particularly useful during software development and testing. For example, it could be used to populate a testing database, create beautiful JSON/XML/HTML files, anonymize data taken from a production service, etc.

This library offers a number of advantages over other similar libraries:

* Performance. Significantly [faster](http://i.imgur.com/pCo6yPA.png) than other similar libraries.
* Completeness. Strives to provide many detailed providers that offer a variety of data generators.
* Simplicity. Does not require any modules other than the Python standard library.

## Installation
To install mimesis, simply use pip:

```zsh
➜  ~ pip install mimesis
```

also you can install it manually:

```zsh
(env) ➜ git clone git@github.com:lk-geimfari/mimesis.git

## Locales
Mimesis currently includes support for 33 different [locales](http://mimesis.readthedocs.io/#id1). You can specify a locale when creating providers and they will return data that is appropriate for the language or country associated with that locale:

>>> de = Personal('de')
>>> pl = Personal('pl')

>>> de.full_name()
'Sabrina Gutermuth'

>>> pl.full_name()
'Światosław Tomankiewicz'
```

## Data providers

Mimesis support over twenty different [data providers](http://mimesis.readthedocs.io/#id2) available, which can produce data related to food, people, computer hardware, transportation, addresses, and more.
